# Setting Up macOS

<Intro />

## 1. System Dependencies ðŸ§°

Make sure you have `xcode` installed.

```sh
$ xcode-select --install
```

## 2. Rustc and Cargo Package Manager ðŸ“¦

The following command will install [rustup], the official installer for [Rust].

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

:::note
We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is the file as a mere [download link][rustup.sh].
:::

To make sure that Rust has been installed successfully, run the following command:

```sh
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.58.1 (db9d1b20b 2022-01-20)
```

You may need to restart your terminal if the command does not work.
